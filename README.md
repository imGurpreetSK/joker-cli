# Joker CLI
An application to fetch jokes from [JokesAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) and show them to the user.

Disclaimer: Some jokes can be nasty! The current implementation fetches dark jokes. Do not use if you're a baby.


## What problem does this project solve?
None. I want to learn rust; this is my first rust project.

I also like humor and plan to iterate on this project to further improve it. 


## How do I see this project evolving?
Not exactly sure yet, though I have some ideas.
- Fetch a new joke every day and show to the user, perhaps in a notification.
- Invocable script to fetch and show joke.
- Store user's joke and time preferences.
- Terminal UI to show fetch status, actionable menu.
- Test on and support multiple OSs
